To try it out, load up ./src/Cellular.hs in GHCi and issue this command:

  genOut (genLoop <nr. of runs> seed)

Change <nr. of runs> to anything you see fit. Also, consider altering the seed and/or the rules and see what happens!

Celluma is currently in planning/pre-alpha. If you want to join, contact me (information at bottom).

Depends:
  * GHC       >=  6.12.3

Future releases will depend on at least:
  * cabal     (for nice packaging)
  * Haskore   (library for audio/music generation)
