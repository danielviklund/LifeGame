-- The Seed type.
type Generation = String
-- The Rule type.
type Rules = [[String]]

-- Adds two generations together for printing. Not needed anymore!
--concatGen :: Generation -> Generation -> Generation
--concatGen gen1 gen2 = gen1 ++ "\n" ++ gen2

-- The print-out
genOut :: Generation -> IO ()
genOut a = putStr (a ++ "\n")

-- Generator loop. Generates the cellular automata. Recursive function.
genLoop :: Int -> Generation -> Generation
genLoop 0 gen = "\n"  -- Base case.
genLoop x gen = (applyRules gen rules (length gen)) ++ "\n" ++ (genLoop (x - 1) (applyRules gen rules (length gen)))

   NOTE: The chars on the rims (head and last) will remain constant throughout the generations, although they _will_ continue to influence the adjecent cell. -}

-- Note: This thing is hairier than Chewbacca on Rogaine. It _MUST_ be flattened out.
